    <p>
    We have price discovery, so how about some truth discovery?  The goal of Assert is to approximate the truth via mechanism design.  We understand context matters, and that it won't be simple, but we hope an innumerable community of good-faith folks will join together in order to back the truth and reward those who valiantly refute untruth.
